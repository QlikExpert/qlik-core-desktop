If you do not agree to the terms of this EULA, do not install, copy, or use the SOFTWARE PRODUCT.\r\n\r\n1. GRANT OF LICENSE\r\n\r\nIn consideration of your payment of applicable license fees, ComponentSpace hereby grants to you, and you accept, a nonexclusive, nontransferable license for a SINGLE SOFTWARE DEVELOPER to install, use, and display a single copy of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT. You may move the SOFTWARE PRODUCT from one computer to another, and the SOFTWARE PRODUCT may be resident on more than one computer at any one time as long as it is only for the use of a SINGLE SOFTWARE DEVELOPER.\r\n\r\nIf you purchase a MULTI-DEVELOPER license for the SOFTWARE PRODUCT, then the EULA extends to include the number of software developers specified by the license.\r\n\r\nIf you purchase a SITE license for the SOFTWARE PRODUCT, then the EULA extends to include all software developers within the purchasing organization and located at the same business address or who from time to time telecommute from home or other locations external to the business address.\r\n\r\nIf you purchase an ENTERPRISE license for the SOFTWARE PRODUCT, then the EULA extends to include all software developers within the purchasing organization and regardless of their location.\r\n\r\nYou may use the SOFTWARE PRODUCT for the purpose of developing your own software applications, in accordance with the terms of this EULA.

EXAMPLE APPLICATIONS\r\n\r\nSolely with respect to those portions of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT identified as example code (\"Example Code\"), ComponentSpace also grants you the right to use and modify the Example Code for the sole purposes of designing, developing, and testing software product(s), and to reproduce and distribute the Example Code, along with any modifications thereof, provided that you agree to: (A) distribute the Example Code only in conjunction with and as a part of a software application product or Web page developed by you that adds significant and primary functionality or design to the Example Code (\"Application\"); (B) not use ComponentSpace’s name, logo, or trademarks to market the Application; (C) include a valid copyright notice on the Application; (D) indemnify, hold harmless, and defend ComponentSpace from and against any claims or lawsuits, including attorney's fees, that arise or result from the use or distribution of the Application; (E) not permit further distribution of the Example Code by your end user.\r\n\r\n6. TERM\r\n\r\nThis EULA shall be perpetual unless you fail to observe any of its terms, in which case it shall terminate immediately, and without additional prior notice, provided, however, that copies of the runtime component of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT that are part of the Applications licensed to third parties may be retained by such licensed third parties in accordance with this EULA. Upon termination or expiration of this EULA, you shall destroy the original and all copies, complete or partial, of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT, and shall not access such media for the purpose of recovering any of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT. The terms of Sections 2, 3, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14 shall survive termination of this EULA.\r\n\r\n7.

In no event shall ComponentSpace’s liability exceed the price paid to ComponentSpace for the SOFTWARE PRODUCT.\r\n\r\n11.

Time Zone Database\r\n\r\n  ICU uses the public domain data and code derived from Time Zone\r\nDatabase for its time zone support. The ownership of the TZ database\r\nis explained in BCP 175: Procedure for Maintaining the Time Zone\r\nDatabase section 7.\r\n\r\n # 7.  Database Ownership\r\n #\r\n #    The TZ database itself is not an IETF Contribution or an IETF\r\n #    document.  Rather it is a pre-existing and regularly updated work\r\n #    that is in the public domain, and is intended to remain in the\r\n #    public domain.  Therefore, BCPs 78 [RFC5378] and 79 [RFC3979] do\r\n #    not apply to the TZ Database or contributions that individuals make\r\n #    to it.  Should any claims be made and substantiated against the TZ\r\n #    Database, the organization that is providing the IANA\r\n #    Considerations defined in this RFC, under the memorandum of\r\n #    understanding with the IETF, currently ICANN, may act in accordance\r\n #    with all competent court orders.  No ownership claims will be made\r\n #    by ICANN or the IETF Trust on the database or the code.  Any person\r\n #    making a contribution to the database or code waives all rights to\r\n #    future claims in that contribution or in the TZ Database.\r\n \r\n"},{"name":"immutable-light","copyright":"Rickard Svensson","year":"2017","version":"0.1.2","license":"MIT","url":"https://github.com/ricsv/immutable-light","text":"MIT License\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2017 Rickard Svensson\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\r\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\r\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\r\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\r\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\r\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\r\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\r\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\r\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

By contrast, the GNU General Public\r\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\r\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\r\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\r\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\r\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\r\nthe GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\r\nyour programs, too.\r\n \r\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\r\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\r\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\r\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\r\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\r\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\r\n \r\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\r\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\r\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\r\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\r\n \r\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\r\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\r\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\r\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\r\nrights.\r\n \r\nWe protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\r\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\r\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\r\n \r\nAlso, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\r\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\r\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\r\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\r\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\r\nauthors' reputations.\r\n \r\nFinally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\r\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\r\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\r\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\r\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\r\n \r\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\r\nmodification follow.\r\n \r\nGNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\r\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\r\n \r\n0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\r\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\r\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\r\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\r\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\r\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\r\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\r\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\r\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\r\n \r\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\r\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\r\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\r\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\r\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\r\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\r\n \r\n1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\r\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\r\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\r\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\r\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\r\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\r\nalong with the Program.\r\n \r\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\r\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\r\n \r\n2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\r\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\r\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\r\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\r\n \r\na) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\r\nstating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\r\n \r\nb) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\r\nwhole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\r\npart thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\r\nparties under the terms of this License.\r\n \r\nc) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\r\nwhen run, you must cause it, when started running for such\r\ninteractive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\r\nannouncement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\r\nnotice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\r\na warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\r\nthese conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\r\nLicense.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\r\ndoes not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\r\nthe Program is not required to print an announcement.)\r\n \r\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\r\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\r\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\r\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\r\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\r\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\r\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\r\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\r\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\r\n \r\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\r\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\r\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\r\ncollective works based on the Program.\r\n \r\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\r\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\r\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\r\nthe scope of this License.\r\n \r\n3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\r\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\r\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\r\n \r\na) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\r\nsource code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\r\n1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\r\n \r\nb) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\r\nyears, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\r\ncost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\r\nmachine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\r\ndistributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\r\ncustomarily used for software interchange; or,\r\n \r\nc) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\r\nto distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\r\nallowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\r\nreceived the program in object code or executable form with such\r\nan offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\r\n \r\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\r\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\r\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\r\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\r\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\r\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\r\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\r\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\r\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\r\nitself accompanies the executable.\r\n \r\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\r\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\r\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\r\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\r\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\r\n \r\n4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\r\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\r\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\r\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\r\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\r\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\r\nparties remain in full compliance.\r\n \r\n5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\r\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\r\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\r\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\r\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\r\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\r\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\r\nthe Program or works based on it.\r\n \r\n6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\r\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\r\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\r\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\r\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\r\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\r\nthis License.\r\n \r\n7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\r\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\r\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\r\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\r\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\r\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\r\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\r\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\r\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\r\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\r\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\r\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\r\n \r\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\r\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\r\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\r\ncircumstances.\r\n \r\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\r\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\r\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\r\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\r\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\r\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\r\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\r\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\r\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\r\nimpose that choice.\r\n \r\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\r\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\r\n \r\n8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\r\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\r\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\r\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\r\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\r\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\r\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\r\n \r\n9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\r\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\r\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\r\naddress new problems or concerns.\r\n \r\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\r\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\r\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\r\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\r\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\r\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\r\nFoundation.\r\n \r\n10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\r\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\r\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\r\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\r\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\r\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\r\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\r\n \r\nNO WARRANTY\r\n \r\n11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\r\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\r\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\r\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\r\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\r\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\r\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\r\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\r\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\r\n \r\n12.

By contrast, the GNU General Public\r\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\r\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\r\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\r\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\r\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\r\nthe GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\r\nyour programs, too.\r\n\r\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\r\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\r\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\r\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\r\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\r\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\r\n\r\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\r\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\r\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\r\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\r\n\r\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\r\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\r\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\r\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\r\nrights.\r\n\r\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\r\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\r\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\r\n\r\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\r\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\r\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\r\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\r\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\r\nauthors' reputations.\r\n\r\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\r\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\r\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\r\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\r\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\r\n\r\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\r\nmodification follow.\r\n\r\n                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\r\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\r\n\r\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\r\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\r\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\r\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\r\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\r\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\r\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\r\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\r\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\r\n\r\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\r\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\r\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\r\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\r\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\r\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\r\n\r\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\r\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\r\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\r\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\r\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\r\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\r\nalong with the Program.\r\n\r\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\r\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\r\n\r\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\r\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\r\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\r\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\r\n\r\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\r\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\r\n\r\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\r\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\r\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\r\n    parties under the terms of this License.\r\n\r\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\r\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\r\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\r\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\r\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\r\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\r\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\r\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\r\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\r\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\r\n\r\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\r\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\r\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\r\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\r\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.

You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\r\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\r\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\r\n\r\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\r\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\r\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\r\n\r\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\r\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\r\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\r\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\r\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\r\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\r\n\r\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\r\n    to distribute corresponding source code.

Any attempt\r\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\r\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\r\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\r\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\r\nparties remain in full compliance.\r\n\r\n  5.

IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\r\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\r\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\r\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\r\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\r\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\r\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\r\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\r\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\r\n\r\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\r\n\r\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\r\n\r\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\r\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\r\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\r\n\r\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\r\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\r\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\r\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\r\n\r\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\r\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\r\n\r\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\r\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\r\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\r\n    (at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\r\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\r\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\r\n\r\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along\r\n    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,\r\n    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.\r\n\r\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\r\n\r\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this\r\nwhen it starts in an interactive mode:\r\n\r\n    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author\r\n    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\r\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\r\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\r\n\r\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\r\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may\r\nbe called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be\r\nmouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\r\n\r\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\r\nschool, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\r\nnecessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\r\n\r\n  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program\r\n  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.\r\n\r\n  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989\r\n  Ty Coon, President of Vice\r\n\r\nThis General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\r\nproprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may\r\nconsider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the\r\nlibrary.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\r\nPublic License instead of this License."},{"name":"jQuery UI","copyright":"jQuery Foundation and other contributors","year":"2016","version":"1.12.1","license":"MIT","url":"http://jqueryui.com/","text":"Copyright jQuery Foundation and other contributors\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\r\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\r\n\"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\r\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\r\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\r\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\r\nthe following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\r\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\r\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\r\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND\r\nNONINFRINGEMENT.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\r\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\r\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\r\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\r\n      License.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\r\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\r\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\r\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\r\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\r\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\r\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\r\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\r\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\r\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\r\n\r\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\r\n\r\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\r\n\r\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\r\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"{}\"\r\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

SCOPE OF LICENSE. The software is licensed, not sold. This agreement only gives you some rights to use the software. Microsoft reserves all other rights. Unless applicable law gives you more rights despite this limitation, you may use the software only as expressly permitted in this agreement. In doing so, you must comply with any technical limitations in the software that only allow you to use it in certain ways. You may not \r\n\r\n· work around any technical limitations in the software; \r\n\r\n· reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the software, except and only to the extent that applicable law expressly permits, despite this limitation; \r\n\r\n· publish the software for others to copy; \r\n\r\n· rent, lease or lend the software; \r\n\r\n· transfer the software or this agreement to any third party; or \r\n\r\n· use the software for commercial software hosting services. \r\n\r\n4.

These laws include restrictions on destinations, end users and end use. For additional information, see www.microsoft.com/exporting. \r\n\r\n7. SUPPORT SERVICES. Because this software is “as is,” we may not provide support services for it. \r\n\r\n8. ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This agreement, and the terms for supplements, updates, Internet-based services and support services that you use, are the entire agreement for the software and support services. \r\n\r\n9. APPLICABLE LAW. \r\n\r\na. United States. If you acquired the software in the United States, Washington state law governs the interpretation of this agreement and applies to claims for breach of it, regardless of conflict of laws principles. The laws of the state where you live govern all other claims, including claims under state consumer protection laws, unfair competition laws, and in tort. \r\n\r\nb. Outside the United States. If you acquired the software in any other country, the laws of that country apply. \r\n\r\n10. LEGAL EFFECT. This agreement describes certain legal rights. You may have other rights under the laws of your country. You may also have rights with respect to the party from whom you acquired the software. This agreement does not change your rights under the laws of your country if the laws of your country do not permit it to do so. \r\n\r\n11. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. THE SOFTWARE IS LICENSED “AS-IS.” YOU BEAR THE RISK OF USING IT. MICROSOFT GIVES NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES OR CONDITIONS.

The above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you because your country may not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential or other damages. \r\n\r\nPlease note: As this software is distributed in Quebec, Canada, some of the clauses in this agreement are provided below in French. \r\n\r\nRemarque : Ce logiciel étant distribué au Québec, Canada, certaines des clauses dans ce contrat sont fournies ci-dessous en français. \r\n\r\nEXONÉRATION DE GARANTIE. Le logiciel visé par une licence est offert « tel quel ». Toute utilisation de ce logiciel est à votre seule risque et péril. Microsoft n’accorde aucune autre garantie expresse.

Vous pouvez obtenir de Microsoft et de ses fournisseurs une indemnisation en cas de dommages directs uniquement à hauteur de 5,00 $ US. Vous ne pouvez prétendre à aucune indemnisation pour les autres dommages, y compris les dommages spéciaux, indirects ou accessoires et pertes de bénéfices. \r\n\r\nCette limitation concerne : \r\n\r\n· tout ce qui est relié au logiciel, aux services ou au contenu (y compris le code) figurant sur des sites Internet tiers ou dans des programmes tiers ; et \r\n· les réclamations au titre de violation de contrat ou de garantie, ou au titre de responsabilité stricte, de négligence ou d’une autre faute dans la limite autorisée par la loi en vigueur. \r\n\r\nElle s’applique également, même si Microsoft connaissait ou devrait connaître l’éventualité d’un tel dommage. Si votre pays n’autorise pas l’exclusion ou la limitation de responsabilité pour les dommages indirects, accessoires ou de quelque nature que ce soit, il se peut que la limitation ou l’exclusion ci-dessus ne s’appliquera pas à votre égard. \r\n\r\nEFFET JURIDIQUE. Le présent contrat décrit certains droits juridiques. Vous pourriez avoir d’autres droits prévus par les lois de votre pays. Le présent contrat ne modifie pas les droits que vous confèrent les lois de votre pays si celles-ci ne le permettent pas. \r\n"},{"name":"MiniZip","copyright":"Gilles Vollant, Mathias Svensson","year":"1998-2010","version":"1.1","license":"Custom","url":"http://www.nf.mpg.de/vinci3/doc/license-minizip.html","text":"Copyright(C) 1998-2010 - by Gilles Vollant.

By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee\r\nyour freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free\r\nfor all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software\r\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it.\r\n(Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Lesser General\r\nPublic License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.\r\n\r\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General\r\nPublic Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute\r\ncopies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive\r\nsource code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use\r\npieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\r\n\r\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you\r\nthese rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to\r\ncertain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee,\r\nyou must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they,\r\ntoo, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know\r\ntheir rights.\r\n\r\nWe protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this\r\nlicense which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.\r\n\r\nAlso, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands\r\nthat there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else\r\nand passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\r\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.\r\n\r\nFinally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the\r\ndanger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in\r\neffect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent\r\nmust be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\r\n\r\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.\r\n\r\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\r\n\r\n0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the\r\ncopyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License.\r\nThe \"Program\", below, refers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\r\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work\r\ncontaining the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or\r\ntranslated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation\r\nin the term \"modification\".) Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\r\n\r\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License;\r\nthey are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output\r\nfrom the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program\r\n(independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.\r\n\r\n1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive\r\nit, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy\r\nan appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices\r\nthat refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients\r\nof the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.\r\n\r\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option\r\noffer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\r\n\r\n2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a\r\nwork based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the\r\nterms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\r\n\r\na) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the\r\nfiles and the date of any change.\r\nb) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains\r\nor is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to\r\nall third parties under the terms of this License.\r\nc) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it,\r\nwhen started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\r\nannouncement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty\r\n(or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\r\nthese conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the\r\nProgram itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based\r\non the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\r\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work\r\nare not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works\r\nin themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute\r\nthem as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a\r\nwork based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License,\r\nwhose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every\r\npart regardless of who wrote it.\r\n\r\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written\r\nentirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of\r\nderivative or collective works based on the Program.\r\n\r\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with\r\na work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the\r\nother work under the scope of this License.\r\n\r\n3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code\r\nor executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\na) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be\r\ndistributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software\r\ninterchange; or,\r\nb) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party,\r\nfor a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\r\nmachine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of\r\nSections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\r\nc) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding\r\nsource code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\r\nreceived the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\r\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it.\r\nFor an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains,\r\nplus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and\r\ninstallation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need\r\nnot include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\r\ncomponents (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs,\r\nunless that component itself accompanies the executable.\r\n\r\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated\r\nplace, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as\r\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source\r\nalong with the object code.\r\n\r\n4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided\r\nunder this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program\r\nis void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who\r\nhave received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\r\nterminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\r\n\r\n5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing\r\nelse grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These\r\nactions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or\r\ndistributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of\r\nthis License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\r\nthe Program or works based on it.\r\n\r\n6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient\r\nautomatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify\r\nthe Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions\r\non the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing\r\ncompliance by third parties to this License.\r\n\r\n7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other\r\nreason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order,\r\nagreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you\r\nfrom the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously\r\nyour obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence\r\nyou may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit\r\nroyalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or\r\nindirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would\r\nbe to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\r\n\r\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance,\r\nthe balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply\r\nin other circumstances.\r\n\r\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property\r\nright claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of\r\nprotecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by\r\npublic license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of\r\nsoftware distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system;\r\nit is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through\r\nany other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.\r\n\r\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the\r\nrest of this License.\r\n\r\n8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by\r\npatents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under\r\nthis License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,\r\nso that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case,\r\nthis License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\r\n\r\n9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public\r\nLicense from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\r\nbut may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\r\n\r\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number\r\nof this License which applies to it and \"any later version\", you have the option of following\r\nthe terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free\r\nSoftware Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you\r\nmay choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\r\n\r\n10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution\r\nconditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is\r\ncopyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we\r\nsometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving\r\nthe free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and\r\nreuse of software generally.\r\n\r\nNO WARRANTY\r\n\r\n11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO\r\nTHE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\r\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER\r\nEXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY\r\nAND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF\r\nTHE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL\r\nNECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\r\n\r\n12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT\r\nHOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE,\r\nBE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL\r\nDAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\r\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES\r\nOR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER\r\nPARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES."},{"name":"Intune App SDK for Android","copyright":"Microsoft Corporation","year":"2018","version":"5.0.2","license":"Custom","url":"https://github.com/msintuneappsdk/ms-intune-app-sdk-android","text":"MICROSOFT SOFTWARE LICENSE TERMS\r\nMICROSOFT INTUNE APP SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT KIT FOR ANDROID\r\nThese license terms are an agreement between Microsoft Corporation (or based on where you live, one of its affiliates) and you.

Time Zone Database\r\n\r\n      ICU uses the public domain data and code derived from Time Zone\r\n    Database for its time zone support. The ownership of the TZ database\r\n    is explained in BCP 175: Procedure for Maintaining the Time Zone\r\n    Database section 7.\r\n\r\n     # 7.  Database Ownership\r\n     #\r\n     #    The TZ database itself is not an IETF Contribution or an IETF\r\n     #    document.  Rather it is a pre-existing and regularly updated work\r\n     #    that is in the public domain, and is intended to remain in the\r\n     #    public domain.  Therefore, BCPs 78 [RFC5378] and 79 [RFC3979] do\r\n     #    not apply to the TZ Database or contributions that individuals make\r\n     #    to it.  Should any claims be made and substantiated against the TZ\r\n     #    Database, the organization that is providing the IANA\r\n     #    Considerations defined in this RFC, under the memorandum of\r\n     #    understanding with the IETF, currently ICANN, may act in accordance\r\n     #    with all competent court orders.  No ownership claims will be made\r\n     #    by ICANN or the IETF Trust on the database or the code.  Any person\r\n     #    making a contribution to the database or code waives all rights to\r\n     #    future claims in that contribution or in the TZ Database.\r\n\r\n    6.

In\r\n        addition, the Modified Version must bear a name that is different\r\n        from the name of the Standard Version.\r\n\r\n        (c)  allow anyone who receives a copy of the Modified Version to\r\n        make the Source form of the Modified Version available to others\r\n        under\r\n\r\n            (i)  the Original License or\r\n\r\n            (ii)  a license that permits the licensee to freely copy,\r\n            modify and redistribute the Modified Version using the same\r\n            licensing terms that apply to the copy that the licensee\r\n            received, and requires that the Source form of the Modified\r\n            Version, and of any works derived from it, be made freely\r\n            available in that license fees are prohibited but Distributor\r\n            Fees are allowed.\r\n\r\n    Distribution of Compiled Forms of the Standard Version\r\n    or Modified Versions without the Source\r\n\r\n    (5)  You may Distribute Compiled forms of the Standard Version without\r\n    the Source, provided that you include complete instructions on how to\r\n    get the Source of the Standard Version.  Such instructions must be\r\n    valid at the time of your distribution.  If these instructions, at any\r\n    time while you are carrying out such distribution, become invalid, you\r\n    must provide new instructions on demand or cease further distribution.\r\n    If you provide valid instructions or cease distribution within thirty\r\n    days after you become aware that the instructions are invalid, then\r\n    you do not forfeit any of your rights under this license.\r\n\r\n    (6)  You may Distribute a Modified Version in Compiled form without\r\n    the Source, provided that you comply with Section 4 with respect to\r\n    the Source of the Modified Version.\r\n\r\n    Aggregating or Linking the Package\r\n\r\n    (7)  You may aggregate the Package (either the Standard Version or\r\n    Modified Version) with other packages and Distribute the resulting\r\n    aggregation provided that you do not charge a licensing fee for the\r\n    Package.  Distributor Fees are permitted, and licensing fees for other\r\n    components in the aggregation are permitted. The terms of this license\r\n    apply to the use and Distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions\r\n    as included in the aggregation.\r\n\r\n    (8) You are permitted to link Modified and Standard Versions with\r\n    other works, to embed the Package in a larger work of your own, or to\r\n    build stand-alone binary or bytecode versions of applications that\r\n    include the Package, and Distribute the result without restriction,\r\n    provided the result does not expose a direct interface to the Package.\r\n\r\n    Items That are Not Considered Part of a Modified Version\r\n\r\n    (9) Works (including, but not limited to, modules and scripts) that\r\n    merely extend or make use of the Package, do not, by themselves, cause\r\n    the Package to be a Modified Version.  In addition, such works are not\r\n    considered parts of the Package itself, and are not subject to the\r\n    terms of this license.\r\n\r\n    General Provisions\r\n\r\n    (10)  Any use, modification, and distribution of the Standard or\r\n    Modified Versions is governed by this Artistic License. By using,\r\n    modifying or distributing the Package, you accept this license. Do not\r\n    use, modify, or distribute the Package, if you do not accept this\r\n    license.\r\n\r\n    (11)  If your Modified Version has been derived from a Modified\r\n    Version made by someone other than you, you are nevertheless required\r\n    to ensure that your Modified Version complies with the requirements of\r\n    this license.\r\n\r\n    (12)  This license does not grant you the right to use any trademark,\r\n    service mark, tradename, or logo of the Copyright Holder.\r\n\r\n    (13)  This license includes the non-exclusive, worldwide,\r\n    free-of-charge patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell,\r\n    sell, import and otherwise transfer the Package with respect to any\r\n    patent claims licensable by the Copyright Holder that are necessarily\r\n    infringed by the Package. If you institute patent litigation\r\n    (including a cross-claim or counterclaim) against any party alleging\r\n    that the Package constitutes direct or contributory patent\r\n    infringement, then this Artistic License to you shall terminate on the\r\n    date that such litigation is filed.\r\n\r\n    (14)  Disclaimer of Warranty:\r\n    THE PACKAGE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER AND CONTRIBUTORS \"AS\r\n    IS' AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES.
